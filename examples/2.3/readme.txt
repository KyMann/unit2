In order to run the main.py file included in the flask_example folder we first need to be in a conda environment that has installed flask. If you have not done that you will need to:

0. open terminal, or gitbash
1. conda create flask_environment
2. source activate flask_environment (if windows you will just source flask_environment you omit "source")
3. conda install flask
