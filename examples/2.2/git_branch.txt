Git Branch Example

A branch is an independant line of development.

If we want to add a new feature, or to squash some bugs we can create a new branch to do so in a safe place away from our main project.

Steps:
0. Change into a local git directory

1. git branch # this shows a list of all branches

2. git branch class2.2 # this creates a new branch in my local directory called class2.2

2a. git branch # this shows a list of all branches, my OS marks the current branch with a star!

3. git checkout class2.2 # this switches from the master branch to the class2.2 branch

3a. git branch # this shows a list of all branches, my current branch is class2.2

4. Make changes to the project, or create new files, or delete files, etc.

5. git add . # git add . adds all files in the current directory

6. git commit -m "Adding the material for class 2.2"

7*. git push --set-upstream origin class2.2 # I needed to include this step because my remote directory does not already contain the class2.2 branch, this command pushes this new empty branch to my remote repository

7. git push origin # if you're branch already exists in your remote directory you can just git push origin like normal.

8. git status # check to make sure you added your code, and you check github.com to see the changes
